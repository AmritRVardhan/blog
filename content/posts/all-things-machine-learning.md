This is a question bank for Machine Learning/Deep Learning/Data Science roles. Over time, I will try to sort this on topics and increasing difficulty.

#  **Explain Machine learning in Layman terms. - Tags [Basic Machine Learning, ]**
Machine Learning is a branch of Data Science that uses algorithms and tries to fit in a function to already given data points so as to better predict an unseen observable data. It comprises of several branches, mainly, supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised and reinforcement learning.
#  **Do you have any training experience in Machine Learning? Elaborate. - Tags [Basic Machine Learning, Behavioral/real-life]**
#  **How do you catch up on on your machine learning knowledge? Tags [Behavioral]**

The below are some youtube channels that I follow to stay up to date with the firld of ML/DL and now LLM. One of my best friends is a senior data scientist, he keeps me up to date with things he does in his org. I also have a keen interest in learning of how things work deeply, so I keep researching.

#  **Explain different types of Machine learning genres/subtypes with their pros and cons. - Tags [Basic Machine Learning, ]**
The four main Machine Learning genres are:  
1. **Supervised Learning**   
Each data point in this scenario has labeled targets to their respective features.  
2. **Unsupervised Learning**  
The dataset available to you does not have labeled outputs. Generally, the ML model finds similar data patterns and clubs them together. Example include K-means clustering, KNN, Anomaly detection, Hierarchial clustering.  
3. **Semi-supervised Learning**  
4. **Reinforcement Learning**
