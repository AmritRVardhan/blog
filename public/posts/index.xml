      <description>Polars are better than Pandas I recently came in touch with Polars after using Pandas for a long while. It has been some learning to migrate from Pandas to Polars. But Polars has been less reliant on RAM and utilizes cores efficiently. Polars is written in Rust, and since Rust is a low level language, it is faster. It also supports Parallelism. On the other hand, Pandas is built on top of NumPy, which in turn is built in C, which should solve inefficiencies, but since there is a level of abstraction of NumPy, the memory handling of Python comes in between.</description>

      <description>F1 Data Conversational Agent So my basic idea is to create a &amp;ldquo;chatbot?&amp;rdquo; for F1 that fetches live data, answers a user query, from OpenF1 and answers questions about all-things-f1. Here are the links I am going through.&#xA;inner thought - hmmm, maybe I need to create architectural decisions right now, some UMLs etc.&#xA;inner demon - Naah bro, this is a self project, who cares about these stuff.&#xA;API with Conversational Agent all-MiniLM-L6-v2 SBERT </description>

      <description>This is the iteration 1 for creating and understanding Agentic views of Conversational AIs. Agentic AIs have recently shown to outperform LLMs alone. MoA has recently beaten GPT-4o.&#xA;I installed Ollama, pulled Lllama-3 8b, read about crewai, played around with Agents and their respective Tools, Actions, Tasks. I plan to extensively use it for my own applications.&#xA;Below is the code for the implementaiton&#xA;from crewai import Task, Agent, Crew, Process from crewai_tools import tool from langchain.</description>

      <description>This is a question bank for Machine Learning/Deep Learning/Data Science roles. Over time, I will try to sort this on topics and increasing difficulty.&#xA;Last update &amp;mdash; 17/07/2024 &amp;mdash;&#xA;Explain Machine learning in Layman terms. - Tags [Basic Machine Learning, ] Machine Learning is a branch of Data Science that uses algorithms and tries to fit in a function to already given data points so as to better predict an unseen observable data.</description>

      <description>These are the walkthroughs/links that helped me deploy this website on Github Pages.&#xA;I procrastinate a lot, so I googled along the lines of &amp;ldquo;Best blog hosted on Github Pages&amp;rdquo; and I chose the first thing I stumbled upon, which was, Archie theme under Hugo.&#xA;Hugo installation can be followed here&#xA;Installed hugo locally and started working on setting up the website locally before deploying it on Github Pages. I had to copy all the files present in themes/archie folder to the root folder after cloning the repo.</description>
