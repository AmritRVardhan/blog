Hi, I am Amrit. I am a software developer by profession. I am interested in Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and the field of Data Science. 

I have a Masters in Computer Science from University of Illinois, Chicago. I worked in Barclays after my undergrad as a SWE for 3+ years. I helped save my organization, cut costs by automating multiple processes. I have developed multiple end-to-end software solutions that required me to do architectural decisions, which included, but not limited to, making Proof-of-concepts, SDD/PDDs, development plan, leading teams, talking to shareholders, developing/coding, doing SITs/UATs, deploying the code in production and providing Level3 support according to the SLA. The tech stack I used was Python, Django, Blue Prism, C#, VBA. 

Post my Master's I am working on Front-end for cloud organization, assessing files by the metrics of their usefulness and relevance to each user. I am using React, Node, PostgreSQL, Supabase, Python to develop.
