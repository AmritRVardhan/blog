This is a question bank for Machine Learning/Deep Learning/Data Science roles. Over time, I will try to sort this on topics and increasing difficulty. 

1. **Explain Machine learning in Layman terms. - Tags [Basic Machine Learning, ]**
1. **Do you have any training experience in Machine Learning? Elaborate. - Tags [Basic Machine Learning, Behavioral/real-life]**
1. **How do you catch up on on your machine learning knowledge? Tags [Behavioral]**
1. **Explain different types of Machine learning genres/subtypes with their pros and cons. - Tags [Basic Machine Learning, ]**
2. **What is the difference between Regression and Classification?**
3. **What is the difference between Structure and Unstructured data?**
4. **What are assumptions of Linear Regression?**
5. **What is multicollienearity and why is it a problem in Linear Regression? Explain methods to combat it.**
6. **In linear regression, what is the value of the sum of residuals for a given dataset?**
7. **What is Homoscedasticity and Heteroscedasticity?**
8. **What are the reasons and effect of Heteroscedasticity on model?**
9. **How to handle problems of Heteroscedasticity on model?**
10. **Do you have experience on Spark or any big data tools for Machine Learning? - Tags [Spark, Big Data, Basic Machine Learning]**
11. **How do you differentiate between deductive and inductive machine learning?**

13. **Explain all performance measuremeant technqiues.**
14. **What is Deep Learning? What is the difference between ML and DL?**
15. **How do you choose an algorithm for a classification problem?**
16. **If your model suffers from low bias and high variance, which algorithm would you use to tackle it? Why?**
17. **How do you handle missiing or corrupted data in a dataset?**
18. **What are some methods of reducing dimensionality?**
19. **What is stratified cross-validation and when is it used?**
