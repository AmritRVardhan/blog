      <description>This is a question bank. At any point of time, I won&amp;rsquo;t think that this question is too basic. I do not want to have knowledge gaps. Over time, I will try to sort this on topics and increasing difficulty. I will have to go through this arduous process and it&amp;rsquo;ll be fun. There should be code with theory, else what is theory if not applied? &amp;lsquo;Here&amp;rsquo; would be the link for codes.</description>

      <description>These are the walkthroughs/links that helped me deploy this website on Github Pages.&#xA;I procrastinate a lot, so I googled along the lines of &amp;ldquo;Best blog hosted on Github Pages&amp;rdquo; and I chose the first thing I stumbled upon, which was, Archie theme under Hugo.&#xA;Hugo installation can be followed here&#xA;Installed hugo locally and started working on setting up the website locally before deploying it on Github Pages. I had to copy all the files present in themes/archie folder to the root folder after cloning the repo.</description>

      <description>Hi, I am Amrit. I am a software developer by profession. I am interested in Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and the field of Data Science.&#xA;I have a Masters in Computer Science from University of Illinois, Chicago. I worked in Barclays after my undergrad as a SWE for 3+ years. I helped save my organization, cut costs by automating multiple processes. I have developed multiple end-to-end software solutions that required me to do architectural decisions, which included, but not limited to, making Proof-of-concepts, SDD/PDDs, development plan, leading teams, talking to shareholders, developing/coding, doing SITs/UATs, deploying the code in production and providing Level3 support according to the SLA.</description>

      <description>This is the iteration 1 for creating and understanding Agentic views of Conversational AIs. Agentic AIs have recently shown to outperform LLMs alone. MoA has recently beaten GPT-4o.&#xA;I installed Ollama, pulled Lllama-3 8b, read about crewai, played around with Agents and their respective Tools, Actions, Tasks. I plan to extensively use it for my own applications.&#xA;Below is the code for the implementaiton&#xA;from crewai import Task, Agent, Crew, Process from crewai_tools import tool from langchain.</description>
